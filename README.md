## Intro
Welcome to DashBot.

I figured I would share this, because anyone manages to leak it.
This is my bot, DashBot, that I have been working on, though, it is still a work in progress.

> The bot uses the dash character, -, to run its commands!

> Use -c to show commands.

## Uses
DashBot has multiple uses, and more to come!
Currently, most of which are for moderation.

### Moderation
#### Clear
Ah, the good old clear command, also better known as "purge".
It works exactly the way you would think, with a maximum of 100 at a time.
It will clear/purge 5 messages as a default.

*Useage:* -clear (amount) *or* -purge (amount)
> Requires the Manage_Messages permission

#### Kick
Pretty self-explanatory, use it to kick members of your server!

*Usage:* -kick (@member you want to kick) (reason, leave blank if none)
> Requires the Kick_Members permission

#### Ban, unban and Banlist
Like the kick command, pretty self-explanatory.
You use it to ban or unban.

*Ban usage:* -ban (@member you want to ban) (reason, leave blank if none)

*Unban usage:* -unban (name#xxxx)

Banlist on the other head, is to check who are banned.

*Banlist usage:* -banlist
> Requires the Ban_Members permission


#### Mute and Unmute
These two commands are self-explanatory again. Does exactly what they say. **(Notice: The bot does not search, or create the role for muting itself. Have a role called "Muted", with the M capitalized, ready)**

*Mute usage:* -mute (@member you want to mute) (length of mute) (reason, leave blank if none)

*Unmute usage:* -unmute (@member you want to unmute)
> Requires the Manage_Roles permission


### Fun and Games
Now we are going on to the fun and games section. Currently, there are not many features, but they will come over time!

#### Ping
Does exactly what it says, it pings the bot!

*Usage:* -ping

#### 8ball
An 8ball command for all your yes and no questions!

*Usage:* -8ball (question you want to ask)

#### RPS
Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the bot!

*Usage:* -rps (rock, paper or scissors)

#### Flip
A coinflip command for those who wants to flip them coins!

*Usage:* -flip (heads or tails)
